# object-detection

You can download my custom pre-made labeled ["Arduino Robot Car" & "person" image](https://goo.gl/PcS5Zs) folder
I use [labelImg]https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImgabel the images, ideally with a program.  

Here is the [file](https://goo.gl/jfdoF2) including checkpoint data, a saved_model directory, and, most importantly, the forzen_inference_graph.pb after   learn my new objects with a pre-trained model.

The model I'm using is "[faster_rcnn_resnet101](https://goo.gl/hYJg6z)"
