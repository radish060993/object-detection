You can download my custom pre-made labeled ["Arduino Robot Car" & "person" image folder] (https://goo.gl/PcS5Zs)

I'm using "[faster_rcnn_resnet101](https://goo.gl/hYJg6z)" model to learn my new objects. 
Here is the [checkpoint data, a saved_model directory, and, most importantly, the forzen_inference_graph.pb file. file] (https://goo.gl/jfdoF2)
